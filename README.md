![app mock up!](/preview/mockup.png "App Mock Up")
This app is an initiative from the Ministry of Higher Education Research Fund conducted by Universiti Malaya to enhance healthcare workers' infection prevention and control (IPC) practices. 

The app serves as a supplement to the IPC training, aiming to enhance users' knowledge, awareness, and practices related to IPC.

It is achieved within the app via:   
1) providing relevant IPC information and;
2) integrating the goals users established during their IPC training.

The app then serves as a reminder for users to maintain proper IPC practices and track their established goals on a daily basis.
